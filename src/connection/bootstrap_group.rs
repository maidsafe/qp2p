//! A `BootstrapGroup` is a group of related connection attempts that is spawned as a result of a
//! bootstrap attempt off the list of proxies available to us. This group can be terminated when
//! any member of the group has been successful in forging a bootstrap connection off a proxy. The
//! termination of the group would result in immediate cancellation of rest of the attempts
//! currently being made by the members of the group and thus an eventual destruction of all such
//! members to not continue to use resources as we no longer require them.
