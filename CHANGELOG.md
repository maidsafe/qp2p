## [0.9.0](https://github.com/maidsafe/qp2p/compare/v0.8.9...v0.9.0) (2020-11-19)


### âš  BREAKING CHANGES

* `QuicP2p::bootstrap` return type changed from `Result<(Endpoint, Connection)>` to `Result<(Endpoint, Connection, IncomingMessages)>`.
* Dropping `Connection` while some send/recv streams are still in scope no longer closes the connection. All those streams must be dropped too before the connection is closed.
*     - `Endpoint::connect_to` now returns pair or `(Connection, Option<IncomingMessages>)` (previously it returned only `Connection`).
    - `Connection::open_bi_stream` renamed to `open_bi` (same as in quinn)
    - `Connection::send` renamed to `send_bi` for consistency
    - `Endpoint::listen` no longer returns `Result`

### Features
